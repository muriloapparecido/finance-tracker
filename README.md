# Personal Finance Tracker

Welcome to my **Personal Finance Tracker** project! This is a simple tool to help users log and track their income and expenses. This project is a work-in-progress as I continue learning and building my web development skills.

---

## Features (Current)
- Built with **HTML** and **CSS** to create a static interface.

---

## Features (Planned)
As I grow my skills, I plan to add:
1. **Interactivity** using **JavaScript**:
   - Enable users to dynamically add, edit, and delete transactions.
   - Calculate and display total income, expenses, and balance.
2. **Data Persistence**:
   - Store transaction data in the browser (e.g., using `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`).
   - Eventually, use a backend database for long-term storage.
3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Make the app mobile-friendly using media queries.

## Skills Used
- **HTML**: To create the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: To style the layout and design.
